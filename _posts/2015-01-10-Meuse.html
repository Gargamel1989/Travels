<p>
	I reached my mental and physical limits after one day of backpacking. A pretty big hit to my self-confidence
	and morale, but I was still determined enough to make it work. Some changes in mindset were needed though.
</p>

<p>
	First point of business was of course to dry my gear, in particular the soaking wet walking shoes. 
	I shared a room with another lazy, workophobic traveller such as myself (only this guy was Walloon, which makes 
	it worse*). He was able to tell me the heating, while making 
	a shitload of noise during the night, did not actually work. Additionally, the hostel would start their yearly
	holiday period the next day, so I would not be able to stay longer if my stuff wasn't dry yet. <i>Great!</i>
</p>

<p>
	New plan:
</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Check out the Valley of the Meuse, which was the entire reason I wanted to come to Namen.</li>
		<li>Get to the nearest hostel on my route as quickly as possible in a way that would not be too taxing on my body (this was apparently in Reims, some 200km away)</li>
		<li>Check out Reims, dry gear and setup for a 3 day hike through the Champagne Region to Paris</li>
	</ol>

<h3>1. Valley of the Meuse</h3>
<p>
	Made my way over to the "Viaduc de la Beez" in the Valley of the Meuse. Took some pics and got some weird moisture
	in the corner of my eyes (probably from the mist, yea that must've been it).

<br />
{% include img.html url='img/meuse/8' %}
<span class="caption text-muted">And it goes on... But I had to head back :(</span>
<br />

<p>
	Definitely something worth revisiting with friends on a sunnier day! I think it would make for a great day-long bike
	ride.
</p>

<p>
	This little trip completely lifted my spirits and was so worth making the detour through Namen. But now it was 
	time to say goodbye and head over to La Douce France!
</p>

<h3>Getting to Reims</h3>

<p>
	I conjured a route that minimized my train costs, didn't deviate too much from my original planned route, only 
	required me to bike for 15km this day and would hopefully still give me some nice nature views:
</p>

<p style="font-family:monospace;font-size:11px;text-align:center;">
	<b>Namen</b> ---&lt;TRAIN&gt;--- <b>Virton</b> ---&lt;BIKE 15km&gt;--- <b>Montmédy</b> ---&lt;TRAIN&gt;--- <b>Reims</b>
</p>


{% include img.html url='img/meuse/bike' %}
<span class="caption text-muted">Riding my bike across the border</span>
<br />
<p>
	I had to wait 2 hours for my train to arrive in Montmédy, so had some time to explore and discover the local 
	stronghold town on a hill
</p>
{% include img.html url='img/meuse/edit' %}
<span class="caption text-muted">Took a shitty picture against the sunlight, so it required some editing :).</span>
<br />
{% include img.html url='img/meuse/v1' %}
<span class="caption text-muted">The view of Montmédy en-route to the stronghold</span>
<br />

<span class="caption text-muted"></span>
<br />
{% include img.html url='img/meuse/v3' %}
<span class="caption text-muted"></span>
<br />
{% include img.html url='img/meuse/v4' %}
<span class="caption text-muted"></span>
<br />
{% include img.html url='img/meuse/v5' %}
<span class="caption text-muted"></span>
<br />
{% include img.html url='img/meuse/v6' %}
<span class="caption text-muted"></span>
<br />

<p>
	Pretty cool. Afterwards took the train to Reims, found the CIS hostel (which was 40% off for some reason)
	and fell asleep immediately after eating my dinner. A good day!

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		There aren't that many hostels in the Ardennen region, nor in France.
	</li>
	<li>
		I can take my bike on the trains in France for free!
	</li>
	<li>
		The CIS hostels spread around France have a special 2015 price, only costing €14 a night.
	</li>
</ul>
