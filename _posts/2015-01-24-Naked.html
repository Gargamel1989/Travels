<p>
	To keep the cost of my stay in Paris within reasonable limits, I had searched for a place to stay through 
	couchsurfing. The first person that replied to my couchsurfing
	request came with a disclaimer saying he lived the
	nudist lifestyle and his guests should be open to trying it themselves. This was definitely 
	out of my comfort zone, but sometimes that can be a good thing which leads to fun experiences and new insights. 
	Upon my arrival, I was pretty much the worst possible
	guest imaginable. I ate his food and his medicine, took a shower and crashed. It was necessary.
</p>

<p>
	The next morning both my knees were hurting, the fever had turned into a full blown flu and my shoulders were
	still blocked. Dr. Google told me the kneepain was a generic case of "Runner's knee", 
	which would be resolved by taking inflammatory medicine, resting and stop being a little bitch. Luckily over the 
	course of my stay the pain slowly subsided. The flu lasted for about 4 days, kept in check by a daily dose of 
	Paracetamol.
	And finally	the shoulders were just a bad case of sore muscles that faded by the end of the week. So my stay in 
	Paris was pretty much a drug fueled tourist trip, the best kind of tourist trip.

	The Louvre was the first place that really blew me away. I generally 
	have a hard time enjoying art, mostly due to my limited knowledge of it. However, my expectations were
	exceeded the moment I stepped into the courtyard of this epic museum. A big shoutout to 
	the audioguides because they were just perfect. Hard to explain but truly an enjoyable experience 
	that I would recommend to everybody. I also may or may not have felt emotions about art once or 
	twice during my visit. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/naked/hipster.jpg">Am I a hipster now?</a>
</p>

<p>
	Anyway, I snapped some great pictures while I was there

	Another pleasant suprise was my tourist tour of the city of Paris. In 3rd grade my high school organized a 
	1-day blitz visit to Paris for our french class. I don't remember much of it, which means it mustn't have been that 
	impressive. With this in mind
	I set out to see some buildings and stuff and my prejudiced brain was again proven wrong.

<p>
	Especially those last two were way more impressive than I remembered from my last visit. Sorry I doubted you, Paris...
</p>

<p>
	The rest of my stay was a combination of cooking for my host (unfortunately his anus did not handle my chili 
	too well), resting my body, watching classic french movies, a three guy butt-naked party (no body fluids were 
	exchanged), vin rouge, pain et fromage and of course trying to get my bike fixed (did not work). Pascal (my 
	hosts name) offered to let me stay for 2 days longer than planned so I could really shake all the fever and
	fatigue, big thanks for that! Unfortunately I forgot to take any pictures of him, but I guess they would have
	needed some heavy blurring anyway.
</p>

<p>
	Leaving Paris after 6 days felt a bit weird. It's funny how fast you become attached to these places...
</p>

<p>
	Oh fuck yea, I forgot. The day before I arrived was the day of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. I saw the events unfold
	from the city where it was happening and saw it almost through French eyes. I decided not to join the big manifestation
	as I would have felt a bit out of place, but I did enjoy the massive crowd going home by metro, so theres that. 
	Anyway, I guess this is mandatory:

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Novel ways of dealing with the last drop when you can't rely on underpants</li>
	<li>
		Nudity does not always have to be associated with sex. It is sometimes also just a lot more comfortable
		than keeping these stupid clothes on
	</li>
	<li>Paris is a really cool city, for some reason I always played it down in my mind until now</li>
</ul>

<h2>In Memoriam</h2>

<p>
	Apparently my cat was hit by a car last week. Her second encounter with a hrududu, only this time she did 
	not manage to escape death :(
</p>

<p>
	By sheer dumb luck, I happened to have made a short video of her a week before my departure while she was
	acting a bit crazy with my tent bag. So this is in remembrance of Stars, the best cat that ever lived. I'll 
	miss you...
