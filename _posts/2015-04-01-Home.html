<p>
	Well, I'm home.
</p>

<p>
	A bit earlier than planned and expected, but there are no regrets. Golden opportunities only come by so often and when they do, you better 
	take them...
</p>

<p>
	It's been a crazy and amazing 3 months that I will cherrish for the rest of my life. A few stories remain untold, but most of you will now
	get to hear the live report if you want.
</p>

<p>
	Can't wait to see you all!
