	After my first night there, I decided to stay in Reims for another day to explore the city and tinker with
	my bike. The saddle had been sliding down during the last 2 days and by now I was practically 
	riding a childrens bike.
</p>
<p>
	Reims turned out to be a fairly nice city with some beautiful buildings, the most notable 
	of course being the cathedral.
</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">The only angle that didn't include ugly scaffolding</span>
<br />

<p>
	The other side of the city, which is just a 1-minute bikeride from the center, was a bit less impressive. 
	Most of the streets and buildings had decayed quite heavily and the people seemed pretty unhappy in general. 
	Les	banlieues? It got me thinking about wealth and freedom and made me a bit sad. Heavy stuff!
</p>

<p>
	On a more positive note, I made my first travel buddy on my second night in Reims. An extremely helpful French
	guy who gave me my first real conversation since starting this journey, some sound travel advice and lended me a bunch of 
	tools he had lying about in his car so I could fix my bike (didn't work, hurt my thumb). Also, for reasons unknown, he
	assumed I did not know what a bundling rope was and went to great heights to explain the intricate details of this novel
	invention.

<span class="caption text-muted">Phuc, I was tired</span>
<br />

<p>
	Next morning was the start of my second attempt to test my multi-day hiking skills. The plan was
	to hike/bike from Reims to the city of Meaux over the course of 3 days. From there it would be relatively cheap
	to take the train to Paris. Sounded great!
</p>

<p>
	Day 1 was beautiful, but unfortunately mostly covered in mist (apparently the French weather guys are just as bad 
	at predicting the weather). After about 1 hour of biking the Google Maps routeplanner decided to fuck me over
	and stop working, so I had to improvise and take a different route. This ended up being a slight detour,
	but probably way more scenic than my original route.

<p>
	By the time I reached my endpoint for the day, Mareuil-le-Port, it had been dark for a good 30 minutes, my 
	shoulders and upper back were completely blocked an my right knee hurt quite a bit. My body sucks... I decided 
	to hit up the local drug dealer and get some of the good stuff*, hoping the pain would be gone by the next morning. 
	I spent my first night with Regina (which is how I have decided to name my tent) in a small public
	park right next to the Marne.  
</p>

<p>
	Day 2 started with some drizzle and mist, only slightly less pain than the evening before and an epic wrong
	turn which led me through some pretty muddy fields (which fucked up my bike even more). This day was also 
	quite boring as far as views go.

<br />

<p>
	The pain in my knees and back had again been steadily increasing throughout the day and by the end were
	accompanied by a slight fever, yet somehow I still managed to
	arrive in Charly-sur-Marne before sunset. After wasting 2 more hours waiting for the darkness I found 
	another small park on the outskirts of town and checked out for the day.
</p>

<p>
	At around 3 in the morning, my night's rest was interrupted by what sounded like someone firing a gun right next
	to me. I was scared like a little bitch, very tired and it was cold outside, so I decided against taking a peak
	and went back to sleep. The next morning did bring me an explanation:
</p>


<a href="/Travels/img/champagne/15-tire.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/Travels/img/champagne/15-tire-thumb.jpg" /></a>
<span class="caption text-muted">This bike man...</span>
<br />

<p>
	With the help of a friendly bypasser and his tools, changing the tire only took me the better part of an hour. 
	After 2 more hours of uphill walking, which by this time would better classified as limping, I came by the sign 
	that meant the end of my woes.
</p>


<a href="/Travels/img/champagne/16-end.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/Travels/img/champagne/16-end-thumb.jpg" /></a>
<span class="caption text-muted">Cheap-ass trains, here I come</span>
<br />

<p>
	
	Since trains within the Île de France region are cheap, I decided the long-term survival of my knees was more
	important than my ego and headed over to the nearest station instead of continuing to Meaux (still 20km left).
	After an hour of feeling like a massive bum taking a train with the shittiest and dirtiest	of bikes, I finally 
	arrived in the City of Love.
</p>

<p>
	So the results of this second test:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wrecked my right knee (unable to put my full body weight + backpack on it)</li>
	<li>A medicated fever (I assumed this was a fatigue fever)</li>
	<li>The inability to look sideways due to upper back pains</li>
	<li>Mentally and physically exhausted</li>
	<li>Didn't achieve my goal</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This is going great! Why didn't anybody tell me this was going to be hard?

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		A bundling rope is a device to tie stuff to your bike's baggage rack. You attach it to the iron platelets
		on either side of the bike using the hooks and put your stuff under the rope.
	</li>
	<li>
		Google Maps is not to be trusted.
	</li>
	<li>
		More extensive testing of the bike is required before embarking on such a journey.
	</li>
	<li>
		Sleeping in a tent for multiple days without having a place to relax for a bit is no fun
	</li>
</ul>
