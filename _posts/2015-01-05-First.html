	My journey started on the 3rd of January in Brussels. Upon opening the front door, I
	was greeted by a moderate drizzle, but the weather forecast had assured me this would clear up by noon.
	After doing a little tourist tour around Brussels/discovering the joys
	of searching for the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_footpath">GR</a> trail markings, making my first stop
	at a local coffee shop and saying my final goodbyes to two friends who had joined me up to this point, I was all by myself.
</p>

<p>
	The weather did <a href="http://1.nieuwsbladcdn.be/Assets/Images_Upload/2013/03/19/201ac360-8f1f-11e2-a8e8-08a2c5f6e1db_original.jpg.h380.jpg">not improve</a> by noon.
	It made crossing the Zoniënwoud an... <i>interesting</i> experience. The rain subdued for a little while after my emerging from the forest, only to return with renewed force not half an
	hour later. After 6 hours of cycling and walking in the rain, I was wet to the core and my morale was already at a
	low point. The sun was setting and I had yet to encounter any potential accommodation (obviously tent was not a feasible option
	at this point). Things got real a lot quicker than I expected...

	At that point I probably made the best decision of the day: Fuck the GR routes, head over to the nearest town and find myself
	a safe haven to regroup. The nearest hostel was in Namen (my planned goal of the day, but at this point still a good 
	40km away), so I rode my bike to the nearest train station and took the next train there.

	After recovering my soaked underpants from halfway up my ass, the best low-power-shower in recent memory and a
	cold beer, I was ready to reconsider my route and planning. All in all not the best way to start a six month journey, 
	and maybe I could have prevented some of these things, but then again, experience is the best teacher.

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		I cannot bike 70km in one day with this pack on my back
	</li>
	<li>
		If rain is a possibility, have accomodation plans in advance and have a backup plan
	</li>
	<li>
		GR routes are not made for bycicles
	</li>
	<li>
		My gear is waterproof, but not after an entire day of rain
	</li>
