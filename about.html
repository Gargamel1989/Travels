	This blog is for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documenting stupid shit I do and lessons learned to prevent myself from making the same mistakes twice</li>
  <li>Keeping friends and family sort of updated on my whereabouts</li>
  <li>Reference material should anybody want to try something similar in the future</li>
  <li>Enlightening the world with my epic writing skills</li>
</ul>

<p>

	<li>I like English</li>

		such as "abysmal".
	</li>
</ul>

	Enjoy!
