<p>
	I knew I liked rocks, and I knew I liked bouldering, but my love for both has been lifted to
	new heights after my stay in Fontainebleau. My initial plan was to spend around 3 days here,
	do some hiking in the woods and maybe climb a bit if the stars aligned. I ended up staying
	12 days and climbing more than I could have imagined.

<h3>12 Nights in Regina</h3>
<p>
	For Regina, this stay was the next big test, but I must say she did marvelous! Through rain, wind and
	snow she kept straight and dry. Some moisture on the insides now and then, but that is to be
	expected. In short, I couldn't have wished for a better tent.

<p>
	My bike on the other hand was becoming more and more of a problem. It had 
	started to become very hard to turn the pedals. The owner of the hostel was friendly enough to lend me
	his tools and after some tinkering I discovered one of the bearings in the back wheel was completely
	shattered.
</p>

<p>
	I spent nearly every evening trying to get the thing working properly but in the end the best I
	could do was get it to a point where both wheels were spinning again. How long this bike will last remains
	to be seen. To be continued I am sure...
</p>


<h3>Discovering Fontainebleau & outdoor climbing</h3>
<p>
	Silly me thought I would explore the climbing area of Fontainebleau the first day and make up a
	planning according to my findings. It soon became clear that the climbing area is more like 100
	climbing areas spread over the entire forest, each containing more boulders than you can 
	count. In short, infinite possibilities...
</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">This is a map of the forest of Fontainebleau. I stayed in La Chapelle La Reine and 
climbed around n° 7 and n° 15. Much left to do as you can see.</span>
<br />

<p>
	My first few days were spent in the 'Eléphant' area. By the 3rd day I was feeling really good and
	my climbing was getting better. Unfortunately the day 3 curse struck and overconfidence kicked in.
	I took a bit of a nasty fall and hurt my right knee. For some reason I was able to keep climbing for 
	the next couple of hours, but after that the pain really kicked in and a 2-day rest period was in order.
</p>

<p>
	Next I hitch-hiked to the 'Canche aux Merciers' site, which was a bit further away from the 
	hostel. Here I met some cool German guys who joined me
	on a route that was supposed to be easy but took us most of the afternoon to figure out.
</p>

<p>
	My final days of climbing were spent with people I met at the hostel. This gave me a chance to
	try some of the harder routes as I now not only had people who could look after me but could also
	use their crashpad (a portable matras that softens your fall). 
	Unfortunately my body was pretty much worn out after this much climbing in so little time. Next time!

	What follows is a large collection of pictures of rocks. If you don't like rocks (really?), I 
	made a convenient little link to skip this part:

<h3>Socializing!</h3>
<p>
	On the second week of my stay in the hostel, a bunch of new people arrived. A couple of Germans,
	a couple of South-Koreans and 3 American guys studying in France for the semester. All really nice 
	people and a good
	reminder why hostels can be awesome.
</p>

<p>
	The German couple asked me if I wanted to join them on their visit to the Chateau of Fontainebleau
	on one of my off days. A bit awkward at times because the girl didn't understand
	a lot of English and my German is just bad (more like Dutch with k&rarr;ch and w&rarr;v) but all
	in all a very enjoyable day.
</p>

<br />

<p>
	I also had quite an interesting talk with the male part of the Korean couple (we climbed together).
	They were on their 8th month of a year long journey, for which they had been saving for 3 years 
	(since they got married). A lot of couples these days only meet at later stages in their lives, usually 
	when they are both alreay working. As a result it is harder to really get to know each other when a big 
	part of your lives
	is spent apart. So not only were they now learning to live together on a whole new level, they were also
	making the journey of their dreams.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely some food for thought there...

<h3>Departure</h3>

<p>
	After 12 days I finally made the decision to leave this awesome place. The weather had taken a turn for the
	worse and all my new friends had left as well :(. I will definitely
	be coming back here some time in the future, but for now it is goodbye. On to new unknown places and
	hopefully be blown away again!

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Fontainebleau is amazing and an infinite source of bouldering fun. Outdoor climbing feels so good.</li>
	<li>
		South-Koreans count differently, eg. Zean was 32 years old in Europe, but 34 in South-Korea. How weird is that?
	</li>
	<li>This bike should have been more thouroughly tested and checked before I left. Yes daddy, you were right again.</li>
</ul>
