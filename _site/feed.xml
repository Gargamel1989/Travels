        <title>Rocks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I knew I liked rocks, and I knew I liked bouldering, but my love for both has been lifted to
	new heights after my stay in Fontainebleau. My initial plan was to spend around 3 days here,
	do some hiking in the woods and maybe climb a bit if the stars aligned. I ended up staying
	12 days and climbing more than I could have imagined.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/01-enter.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/01-enter-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Now entering Fontainebleau.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;12 Nights in Regina&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For Regina, this stay was the next big test, but I must say she did marvelous! Through rain, wind and
	snow she kept straight and dry. Some moisture on the insides now and then, but that is to be
	expected. In short, I couldn&#39;t have wished for a better tent. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/06-regina1.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/06-regina1-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/06-regina2.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/06-regina2-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Good girl&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	My bike on the other hand was becoming more and more of a problem. It had 
	started to become very hard to turn the pedals. The owner of the hostel was friendly enough to lend me
	his tools and after some tinkering I discovered one of the bearings in the back wheel was completely
	shattered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I spent nearly every evening trying to get the thing working properly but in the end the best I
	could do was get it to a point where both wheels were spinning again. How long this bike will last remains
	to be seen. To be continued I am sure...
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Discovering Fontainebleau &amp; outdoor climbing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Silly me thought I would explore the climbing area of Fontainebleau the first day and make up a
	planning according to my findings. It soon became clear that the climbing area is more like 100
	climbing areas spread over the entire forest, each containing more boulders than you can 
	count. In short, infinite possibilities...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/02-overview.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/02-overview-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;This is a top down view of half of 1 climbing area called &#39;Eléphant&#39;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/larchant-map.jpg&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/larchant-map-thumb.jpg&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;This is La forêt de Larchant, the piece of the forest containing the Eléphant site.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/font.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/font-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;This is a map of the forest of Fontainebleau. I stayed in La Chapelle La Reine and 
climbed around n° 7 and n° 15. Much left to do as you can see.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	My first few days were spent in the &#39;Eléphant&#39; area. By the 3rd day I was feeling really good and
	my climbing was getting better. Unfortunately the day 3 curse struck and overconfidence kicked in.
	I took a bit of a nasty fall and hurt my right knee. For some reason I was able to keep climbing for 
	the next couple of hours, but after that the pain really kicked in and a 2-day rest period was in order.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Next I hitch-hiked to the &#39;Canche aux Merciers&#39; site, which was a bit further away from the 
	hostel. Here I met some cool German guys who joined me
	on a route that was supposed to be easy but took us most of the afternoon to figure out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	My final days of climbing were spent with people I met at the hostel. This gave me a chance to
	try some of the harder routes as I now not only had people who could look after me but could also
	use their crashpad (a portable matras that softens your fall). 
	Unfortunately my body was pretty much worn out after this much climbing in so little time. Next time!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/14-fingers.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/14-fingers-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;2 of my fingers after 6 days of climbing. Easily the worst place for blisters if have ever experienced.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	What follows is a large collection of pictures of rocks. If you don&#39;t like rocks (really?), I 
	made a convenient little link to skip this part:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The rock on the left is called l&#39;Elephant after which this area is named. It looks more like an elephant from the other side.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The rock is called &#39;Les fesses&#39;, the route is aptly called &#39;La

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Nature man...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Socializing!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the second week of my stay in the hostel, a bunch of new people arrived. A couple of Germans,
	a couple of South-Koreans and 3 American guys studying in France for the semester. All really nice 
	people and a good
	reminder why hostels can be awesome.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The German couple asked me if I wanted to join them on their visit to the Chateau of Fontainebleau
	on one of my off days. A bit awkward at times because the girl didn&#39;t understand
	a lot of English and my German is just bad (more like Dutch with k&amp;rarr;ch and w&amp;rarr;v) but all
	in all a very enjoyable day.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/07-chateau1.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/07-chateau1-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;A room in the Chateau, looks better in real life...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;View from window&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/10-chateau4.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/10-chateau4-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;This cabinet was actually really awesome. Very intricate design and 
beautifully ornamented.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/11-chateau5.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/11-chateau5-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The absurdly large gardens of the Chateau.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I also had quite an interesting talk with the male part of the Korean couple (we climbed together).
	They were on their 8th month of a year long journey, for which they had been saving for 3 years 
	(since they got married). A lot of couples these days only meet at later stages in their lives, usually 
	when they are both alreay working. As a result it is harder to really get to know each other when a big 
	part of your lives
	is spent apart. So not only were they now learning to live together on a whole new level, they were also
	making the journey of their dreams.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Definitely some food for thought there...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/13-people.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/13-people-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Zean and Yil.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Departure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	After 12 days I finally made the decision to leave this awesome place. The weather had taken a turn for the
	worse and all my new friends had left as well :(. I will definitely
	be coming back here some time in the future, but for now it is goodbye. On to new unknown places and
	hopefully be blown away again!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/12-broth.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/12-broth-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Packing the chicken broth I made the day before. This is how it&#39;s supposed to look, right?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

	Also this random picture of bread that I couldn&#39;t fit anywhere else:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/05-bread.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/rocks/05-bread-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Have you ever seen a loaf of bread this big??? Even Walter can&#39;t get over it.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted pull-left text-left&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fontainebleau is amazing and an infinite source of bouldering fun. Outdoor climbing feels so good.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		South-Koreans count differently, eg. Zean was 32 years old in Europe, but 34 in South-Korea. How weird is that?
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This bike should have been more thouroughly tested and checked before I left. Yes daddy, you were right again.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;
	To keep the cost of my stay in Paris within reasonable limits, I had searched for a place to stay through 
	couchsurfing. The first person that replied to my couchsurfing
	request came with a disclaimer saying he lived the
	nudist lifestyle and his guests should be open to trying it themselves. This was definitely 
	out of my comfort zone, but sometimes that can be a good thing which leads to fun experiences and new insights. 
	Upon my arrival, I was pretty much the worst possible
	guest imaginable. I ate his food and his medicine, took a shower and crashed. It was necessary.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The next morning both my knees were hurting, the fever had turned into a full blown flu and my shoulders were
	still blocked. Dr. Google told me the kneepain was a generic case of &quot;Runner&#39;s knee&quot;, 
	which would be resolved by taking inflammatory medicine, resting and stop being a little bitch. Luckily over the 
	course of my stay the pain slowly subsided. The flu lasted for about 4 days, kept in check by a daily dose of 
	Paracetamol.
	And finally	the shoulders were just a bad case of sore muscles that faded by the end of the week. So my stay in 
	Paris was pretty much a drug fueled tourist trip, the best kind of tourist trip.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Visit to the museum of space and aviation, Belgian Military plane from WW I. Let&#39;s 
all take a moment here and realize these guys were shooting at each other from planes made of bamboo...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The Louvre was the first place that really blew me away. I generally 
	have a hard time enjoying art, mostly due to my limited knowledge of it. However, my expectations were
	exceeded the moment I stepped into the courtyard of this epic museum. A big shoutout to 
	the audioguides because they were just perfect. Hard to explain but truly an enjoyable experience 
	that I would recommend to everybody. I also may or may not have felt emotions about art once or 
	twice during my visit. &lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/naked/hipster.jpg&quot;&gt;Am I a hipster now?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Anyway, I snapped some great pictures while I was there
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Another pleasant suprise was my tourist tour of the city of Paris. In 3rd grade my high school organized a 
	1-day blitz visit to Paris for our french class. I don&#39;t remember much of it, which means it mustn&#39;t have been that 
	impressive. With this in mind
	I set out to see some buildings and stuff and my prejudiced brain was again proven wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Especially those last two were way more impressive than I remembered from my last visit. Sorry I doubted you, Paris...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The rest of my stay was a combination of cooking for my host (unfortunately his anus did not handle my chili 
	too well), resting my body, watching classic french movies, a three guy butt-naked party (no body fluids were 
	exchanged), vin rouge, pain et fromage and of course trying to get my bike fixed (did not work). Pascal (my 
	hosts name) offered to let me stay for 2 days longer than planned so I could really shake all the fever and
	fatigue, big thanks for that! Unfortunately I forgot to take any pictures of him, but I guess they would have
	needed some heavy blurring anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Leaving Paris after 6 days felt a bit weird. It&#39;s funny how fast you become attached to these places...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Also, the day before I arrived was the day of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. I saw the events unfold
	from the city where it was happening and saw it almost through French eyes. I decided not to join the big manifestation
	as I would have felt a bit out of place, but I did enjoy the massive crowd going home by metro, so theres that. 
	Anyway, I guess this is mandatory:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Novel ways of dealing with the last drop when you can&#39;t rely on underpants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Nudity does not always have to be associated with sex. It is sometimes also just a lot more comfortable
		than keeping these stupid clothes on
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paris is a really cool city, for some reason I always played it down in my mind until now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In Memoriam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Apparently my cat was hit by a car last week. Her second encounter with a hrududu, only this time she did 
	not manage to escape death :(
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	By sheer dumb luck, I happened to have made a short video of her a week before my departure while she was
	acting a bit crazy with my tent bag. So this is in remembrance of Stars, the best cat that ever lived. I&#39;ll 
	miss you...
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Champagne</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After my first night there, I decided to stay in Reims for another day to explore the city and tinker with
	my bike. The saddle had been sliding down during the last 2 days and by now I was practically 
	riding a childrens bike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Reims turned out to be a fairly nice city with some beautiful buildings, the most notable 
	of course being the cathedral.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/champagne/01-reims-cat.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/champagne/01-reims-cat-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The only angle that didn&#39;t include ugly scaffolding&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The other side of the city, which is just a 1-minute bikeride from the center, was a bit less impressive. 
	Most of the streets and buildings had decayed quite heavily and the people seemed pretty unhappy in general. 
	Les	banlieues? It got me thinking about wealth and freedom and made me a bit sad. Heavy stuff!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	On a more positive note, I made my first travel buddy on my second night in Reims. An extremely helpful French
	guy who gave me my first real conversation since starting this journey, some sound travel advice and lended me a bunch of 
	tools he had lying about in his car so I could fix my bike (didn&#39;t work, hurt my thumb). Also, for reasons unknown, he
	assumed I did not know what a bundling rope was and went to great heights to explain the intricate details of this novel
	invention. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/champagne/02-phuc.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/champagne/02-phuc-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Phuc, I was tired&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Next morning was the start of my second attempt to test my multi-day hiking skills. The plan was
	to hike/bike from Reims to the city of Meaux over the course of 3 days. From there it would be relatively cheap
	to take the train to Paris. Sounded great!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Day 1 was beautiful, but unfortunately mostly covered in mist (apparently the French weather guys are just as bad 
	at predicting the weather). After about 1 hour of biking the Google Maps routeplanner decided to fuck me over
	and stop working, so I had to improvise and take a different route. This ended up being a slight detour,
	but probably way more scenic than my original route.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;For some reason, French churches are so much cooler than Belgian churches&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;One of these in every village I came through today&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	By the time I reached my endpoint for the day, Mareuil-le-Port, it had been dark for a good 30 minutes, my 
	shoulders and upper back were completely blocked an my right knee hurt quite a bit. My body sucks... I decided 
	to hit up the local drug dealer and get some of the good stuff*, hoping the pain would be gone by the next morning. 
	I spent my first night with Regina (which is how I have decided to name my tent) in a small public
	park right next to the Marne.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Day 2 started with some drizzle and mist, only slightly less pain than the evening before and an epic wrong
	turn which led me through some pretty muddy fields (which fucked up my bike even more). This day was also 
	quite boring as far as views go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;My companion throughout most of this day: The Marne&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The pain in my knees and back had again been steadily increasing throughout the day and by the end were
	accompanied by a slight fever, yet somehow I still managed to
	arrive in Charly-sur-Marne before sunset. After wasting 2 more hours waiting for the darkness I found 
	another small park on the outskirts of town and checked out for the day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	At around 3 in the morning, my night&#39;s rest was interrupted by what sounded like someone firing a gun right next
	to me. I was scared like a little bitch, very tired and it was cold outside, so I decided against taking a peak
	and went back to sleep. The next morning did bring me an explanation:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/champagne/15-tire.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/champagne/15-tire-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;This bike man...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	With the help of a friendly bypasser and his tools, changing the tire only took me the better part of an hour. 
	After 2 more hours of uphill walking, which by this time would better classified as limping, I came by the sign 
	that meant the end of my woes.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/champagne/16-end.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/champagne/16-end-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Cheap-ass trains, here I come&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	
	Since trains within the Île de France region are cheap, I decided the long-term survival of my knees was more
	important than my ego and headed over to the nearest station instead of continuing to Meaux (still 20km left).
	After an hour of feeling like a massive bum taking a train with the shittiest and dirtiest	of bikes, I finally 
	arrived in the City of Love.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	So the results of this second test:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wrecked my right knee (unable to put my full body weight + backpack on it)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A medicated fever (I assumed this was a fatigue fever)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The inability to look sideways due to upper back pains&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mentally and physically exhausted&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Didn&#39;t achieve my goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	This is going great! Why didn&#39;t anybody tell me this was going to be hard?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A bundling rope is a device to tie stuff to your bike&#39;s baggage rack. You attach it to the iron platelets
		on either side of the bike using the hooks and put your stuff under the rope.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Google Maps is not to be trusted.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		More extensive testing of the bike is required before embarking on such a journey.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sleeping in a tent for multiple days without having a place to relax for a bit is no fun
	&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Meuse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I reached my mental and physical limits after one day of backpacking. A pretty big hit to my self-confidence
	and morale, but I was still determined enough to make it work. Some changes in mindset were needed though.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	First point of business was of course to dry my gear, in particular the soaking wet walking shoes. 
	I shared a room with another lazy, workophobic traveller such as myself (only this guy was Walloon, which makes 
	it worse*). He was able to tell me the heating, while making 
	a shitload of noise during the night, did not actually work. Additionally, the hostel would start their yearly
	holiday period the next day, so I would not be able to stay longer if my stuff wasn&#39;t dry yet. &lt;i&gt;Great!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	New plan:
&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Check out the Valley of the Meuse, which was the entire reason I wanted to come to Namen.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Get to the nearest hostel on my route as quickly as possible in a way that would not be too taxing on my body (this was apparently in Reims, some 200km away)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Check out Reims, dry gear and setup for a 3 day hike through the Champagne Region to Paris&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
	
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Valley of the Meuse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Made my way over to the &quot;Viaduc de la Beez&quot; in the Valley of the Meuse. Took some pics and got some weird moisture
	in the corner of my eyes (probably from the mist, yea that must&#39;ve been it).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/meuse/1.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/meuse/1-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;More rocks that did something special to my heart&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;And it goes on... But I had to head back :(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Definitely something worth revisiting with friends on a sunnier day! I think it would make for a great day-long bike
	ride.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	This little trip completely lifted my spirits and was so worth making the detour through Namen. But now it was 
	time to say goodbye and head over to La Douce France!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting to Reims&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I conjured a route that minimized my train costs, didn&#39;t deviate too much from my original planned route, only 
	required me to bike for 15km this day and would hopefully still give me some nice nature views:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:monospace;font-size:11px;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Namen&lt;/b&gt; ---&amp;lt;TRAIN&amp;gt;--- &lt;b&gt;Virton&lt;/b&gt; ---&amp;lt;BIKE 15km&amp;gt;--- &lt;b&gt;Montmédy&lt;/b&gt; ---&amp;lt;TRAIN&amp;gt;--- &lt;b&gt;Reims&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Riding my bike across the border&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I had to wait 2 hours for my train to arrive in Montmédy, so had some time to explore and discover the local 
	stronghold town on a hill
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/meuse/edit.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/meuse/edit-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	Pretty cool. Afterwards took the train to Reims, found the CIS hostel (which was 40% off for some reason)
	and fell asleep immediately after eating my dinner. A good day!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		There aren&#39;t that many hostels in the Ardennen region, nor in France.
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I can take my bike on the trains in France for free!
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The CIS hostels spread around France have a special 2015 price, only costing €14 a night.
	&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Start</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
	My journey started on the 3rd of January in Brussels. Upon opening the front door, I
	was greeted by a moderate drizzle, but the weather forecast had assured me this would clear up by noon.
	After doing a little tourist tour around Brussels/discovering the joys
	of searching for the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_footpath&quot;&gt;GR&lt;/a&gt; trail markings, making my first stop
	at a local coffee shop and saying my final goodbyes to two friends who had joined me up to this point, I was all by myself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The weather did &lt;a href=&quot;http://1.nieuwsbladcdn.be/Assets/Images_Upload/2013/03/19/201ac360-8f1f-11e2-a8e8-08a2c5f6e1db_original.jpg.h380.jpg&quot;&gt;not improve&lt;/a&gt; by noon.
	It made crossing the Zoniënwoud an... &lt;i&gt;interesting&lt;/i&gt; experience. The rain subdued for a little while after my emerging from the forest, only to return with renewed force not half an
	hour later. After 6 hours of cycling and walking in the rain, I was wet to the core and my morale was already at a
	low point. The sun was setting and I had yet to encounter any potential accommodation (obviously tent was not a feasible option
	at this point). Things got real a lot quicker than I expected...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/Travels/img/start/drying.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Travels/img/start/drying-thumb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;A nice place to watch the sunset and feel the panic flooding into your brain!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	At that point I probably made the best decision of the day: Fuck the GR routes, head over to the nearest town and find myself
	a safe haven to regroup. The nearest hostel was in Namen (my planned goal of the day, but at this point still a good 
	40km away), so I rode my bike to the nearest train station and took the next train there. 
&lt;/p&gt;	
	
&lt;p&gt;
	After recovering my soaked underpants from halfway up my ass, the best low-power-shower in recent memory and a
	cold beer, I was ready to reconsider my route and planning. All in all not the best way to start a six month journey, 
	and maybe I could have prevented some of these things, but then again, experience is the best teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		I cannot bike 70km in one day with this pack on my back
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		If rain is a possibility, have accomodation plans in advance and have a backup plan
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		GR routes are not made for bycicles
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		My gear is waterproof, but not after an entire day of rain
	&lt;/li&gt;
